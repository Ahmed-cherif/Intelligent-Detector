# Intelligent-Detector
## Introduction
Intelligent Detector is a project that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to identify and classify objects in images or video streams. This project can be used for various applications, such as surveillance, security, and monitoring.

Features
Real-time object detection.
Classification of objects into predefined categories.
Support for both image and video input.
Easy-to-use Python code.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine.

##Prerequisites
----------------------------
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Ultralytics YOLO (PyTorch-based object detection library)

## Dependencies and Installation
----------------------------
To install the MultiPDF Chat App, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python-headless ultralytics
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   python PPEDetection.py
   ```
4. The output will display real-time object detection with classification.

## Configuration
You can configure the classes you want to detect by modifying the classNames list in the Python script. You can also adjust the confidence threshold to control which detections are displayed.
